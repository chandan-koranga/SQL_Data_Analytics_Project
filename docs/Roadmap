# Advanced Analytics

Once the data is understood, the next step is to apply deeper analytical techniques for business insights and decision-making.

# *Components of Advanced Analytics:*
1. Change-Over-Time Trends → Track growth, decline, or seasonal patterns.
2. Cumulative Analysis → Study cumulative growth (e.g., running totals of revenue, active users).
3. Performance Analysis → Measure KPIs, compare against goals, and evaluate efficiency.
4. Part-to-Whole Analysis → Understand proportions (e.g., % contribution of each product to total sales).
5. Data Segmentation → Group customers/products into meaningful clusters (e.g., VIP, Regular, New).
6. Reporting → Summarize and present results in dashboards or reports for decision-making.
